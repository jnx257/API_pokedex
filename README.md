# API_pokedex
This is my fist truly project learning/using node methods, i've learned some about API, in case REST API.
I've used as a base, a JSON in the current link <a>https://ifpb.github.io/intin-topicos/desafios/pokedex/code/data/pokedex.json</a>. Soon I pretend to continue this using some HTML/CSS (probably i'll use/learn to react) and ading image file to all firts generation pokemons.

If you have anything to add/help me. pls contact me.
thx


jnx.
