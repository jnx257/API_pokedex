# API_pokedex

The main function of this API is a CRUD (CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE)
This is a basic pokedex API. For this API i've used Node.js <a href='https://github.com/expressjs/express'>Express</a> framework.
And as a DB, a JSON in the current link <a>https://ifpb.github.io/intin-topicos/desafios/pokedex/code/data/pokedex.json</a>.

# HTTP METHODS
My API got five methods:
GET - shows every pokemon description: name, id, types and a image.
GET (including the pokemon ID in URL) - shows the specific pokemon details.
POST - Add in DB information of a new pokemon (name, type and image).
PUT - Change pokemon details.

# HTML / DEPLOY
In my gh repository you can find some HTML/CSS files, i've created then and passed in my deploy (where you can find at:<a>https://jnxpokedex.fly.dev/</a>), the design is kind ugly but was only a easy way to apply it. 

# CONSIDERATIONS 
This was a study to learning some about Node frameworks, middlewares, HTTP methods, deploying  etc. Please don't take much seriously at this time...
If you have anything that coul help me improve my code and "coding knowledge", I would be glad.

Thank you.

jnx.
